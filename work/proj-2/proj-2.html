				<h4>Cafe Maryli</h4>

				<p>Cafe Maryli was one of the earliest projects that I undertook.
					That was when I started learning about web development. Cafe Maryli was more of a <strong>passion
					project</strong>, A website for small buisness Cafes which would help the customer
					digitally navigate through the cafe by <strong>sharing</strong> reviews, keeping track of the
					<strong>menu</strong> and <strong>reserving tables</strong> or even a food item of their choice before hand.
					Cafe Maryli was designed to provide good customer service along with great food
					in a comfortable ambience.

				<p>
					The "Homepage" and the "Menu" section was designed and developed for users throughout various platforms.
					The <strong>ergonomic design</strong> of the homepage eables the site to be ported on any device without much change in the layout
					of the page.<strong>Javascript</strong> has also been integrated to make the UX fluid and and the animation crisp.

				<h4>Mobile Responsive</h4>

					Cafe Maryli was also designed to run on mobile devices in the form of <strong>mobile website</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong> therefore
					it was an obvious choice to make it mobile responsive for various phones and tablets.
