				<h4> Kiwi Circular Sheet </h4>
				<img src="work/proj-1/kiwi-result.jpg" alt="kiwi-result">
				<p>Kiwi Circular Sheet was a the first project I undertook on a professional scale for a company called Kiwi.
					Kiwi is a Q&A app for iPhone and Android that is its own social network for asking and answering questions.
					The Circular which I was assigned to develop was the official circular for <strong>Kiwi Co.</strong> This project was handed
					to me by a Kiwi Co. Designer in Gurgoan.

				<h4>Project Development</h4>
				<img src="work/proj-1/kiwi-desktop.jpg" alt="kiwi-desktop">
				<p>This Circular is developed using <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>. The completion of the project took roughly 2 hours.
					The Circular is completely compatable for high resolution <strong>1080p screens</strong> and completely <strong>scalable.</strong>

				<h4>Mobile Responsive</h4>
				<img src="work/proj-1/kiwi-mobile.png" alt="kiwi-mobile">
				<p>I make a point to make all my designs mobile responsive for them to work on a <strong>wider range of plateforms</strong>. Thats the reason why I made this project mobile responsive
					despite of the circular being "desktop only".
